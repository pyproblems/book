# Imperial Physics PyProblems

`PyProblems` is a new initiative developed in the Imperial College Department of Physics which aims to provide students with additional, extracurricular opportunity to develop their Python simulation and problem-solving skills. These exercises are based on the content covered by the 1st and 2nd year Physics curriculum, and so aims to help reinforce the understanding of Physics concepts simultaneously.

Here you will find both problems, and solutions in Jupyter notebook form, listed by the course to which they are relevant. Do try the problems before checking the answers, and do download the Jupyter notebooks of the solutions and have a go at modifying them yourselves.

## Support Sessions

The PyProblems initiative is supported by bi-weekly sessions which will be held remotely. You can attend these for help with doing these problems, or for any other Python support. Further details will be provided here when confirmed.
